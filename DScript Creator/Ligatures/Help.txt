How to use the DScript editor:
Type your text into the input field and hit 'translate'.

Use the '_' as an extended wordline.
Standard connection: Out 2 to In 1.
Specifiy your own connection with (out,in-) 
e.g. tex(3,1-t)

You can construct multiple sidechains that way.
flo(3,1-we)r (in this case 'we' and 'r' are connected to the 'o')

You can use special glyphs and ligatues with square brackets:
s[t2]ar uses the alterntive t (=T2)
